        Gotu kola is a member of the parsley family and is used to balance out the nervous system. It not only aids in stress reduction and reducing anxiety, but it also improves mental alertness and memory. This herb is a relaxant and is caffeine-free, despite the word <em>kola</em> in its name.

        <p><h3>Ginseng</h3>
        Ginseng contains <em>ginsenosides</em> which have anti-oxitant and anti-inflammatory functions and also aid in brain function by stimulating the release of acetylcholine which is a neurotransmitter associated with learning and memory. When taken together with Gingko, both working and long-term memory are enhanced. Ginseng also boosts mood and increases resilience to stress.

        <p><h3>Peppermint</h3>
        Peppermint increases alertness, memory and cognitive function. The scent or taste of peppermint stimulates the hippocampus in the brain which plays an important role in memory. It also slows the release of the stress-hormone cortisol and therefore has a calming effect on the body.
