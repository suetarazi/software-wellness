    <article><p>Yes, I see you! You, totally in the zone at your computer. You've been there a while...quite unsure of just how much time has passed! You're turtled over in your chair, chin jutted forward at your screen, shoulders hunched and body slouched, totally unaware of how you're sitting. And you see, after several years of working as Physical Therapist, I can't help but notice the way people sit, stand and move around. I also take in what I hear: several complaints of back pain, neck pain and arm pain. <br><br>
    Now that I am a software developer too, I see this as an opportunity to give back to my community. While I have not done a thorough examination on any of you, and this website should not be perceived as medical advice, there are some general things we can all do to take better care of our bodies so they can serve us better in our careers. Here are a few ways we can start! <br><br>
    <h3>Take frequent stretch breaks</h3> <br><br>
    Taking even a minute or two every 30 minutes or so can help preserve our bodies ability to stay better aligned at a computer. See the video below for a short stretching routine to get our spine moving, our chest open and muscles of our back and legs elongated. <br><br>

    <h3>Take time for regular exercise</h3>
    Taking time to walk and move around at least once a day makes a huge difference. When we sit for long periods, the muscles on the back of our legs get tight, our low back loses alignment, and our chest and hips get tight. Research has shown sitting is indeed the most compressive position for our spine. That said, static standing is only slightly better, so don't think getting a standing desk will solve all these issues. See the video below for a routine that offers some gentle spine mobility and hip opening. <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <h3>Strengthen your upper back, core and glutes</h3>
    With prolonged sitting, the muscles of our upper back, core and glutes are often weak. These muscles happen to offer a lot of stability to our body so its wise to keep them strong. See the video below for a couple of strengthening exercises that tackle all three areas at once. <br><br>
