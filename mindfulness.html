        <h1>Mindfulness</h1>
        <section>Mindfulness and stress reduction can play a important part in allowing you to function at your best. When we are feeling stressed or our mind is preoccupied, we have difficulty focusing on tasks at hand and our problem-solving skills become compromised.</section>

        <p>Daily meditation, even just a few minutes a day, can allow us to take control of our busy mind and train our mind to focus on tasks and activities without being as distracted.<br><br><br><br>
        There are many different meditation techniques that work. Here's one that I find simple and effective.<br><br>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a timer for anywhere between 5-8 minutes. Longer works fine too if you'd like.</li>
        <li>Begin sitting in good posture on the floor. You may need to sit on a cushion or folded blanket to keep yourself seated on your sit-bones. Alternatively, you can sit in a chair.</li>
        <li>Begin by taking deep inhalations and exhalations. Let your breathing be slow.</li>
        <li>Allow your mind to focus on your breath, but not on anything else until the timer goes off.</li>
        <li>Understand that meditation is a practice. Your mind WILL wander, especially at first. Be kind to yourself and just gently refocus when that happens.</li> 
    </ol>
